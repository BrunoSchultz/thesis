\section{Clusters and groups of galaxies}
Throughout the Universe, galaxies are not distributed homogeneously but are instead aggregated into massive cosmic structures known as galaxy groups or galaxy clusters. Galaxy clusters -- the largest relaxed structures in the Universe -- typically have masses exceeding \(M \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}\), whereas galaxy groups have masses around \(M \sim 3 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}\) (\cite{Schneider_2006}). Advancements in X-ray astronomy have demonstrated that these structures are significant sources of X-ray radiation (\cite{Cavaliere_1971}). This emission is well understood to originate from a hot intergalactic gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM), which is characterized by temperatures in the range of \(10^7\) to \(10^8\) K and constitutes the primary baryonic component of galaxy clusters (\cite{Schneider_2006}).

\subsection{The Intracluster Medium (ICM)}
Within the deep gravitational wells of galaxy clusters, the temperatures become sufficiently high to fully ionize lighter elements and partially ionize heavier elements, resulting in the formation of a plasma. This hot, diffuse, and optically thin plasma, known as the Intracluster Medium (ICM), emits significant amounts of X-ray radiation. X-ray analysis of the ICM have enabled a wide variety of cosmological studies, including large-scale structure formation in the Universe (\cite{KravtsovBorgani2012}).

\subsection{Emission Processes within the ICM} 
A key principle of electrodynamics is that accelerated charges radiate energy. This radiation is referred to as bremsstrahlung or "free-free" when a free charged particle, typically an electron, is accelerated by the electric field of other charges, usually ions. In the ICM, this process predominates at temperatures above \(k_B T_\text{e} \gtrsim \SI{2}{\kilo\electronvolt}\), where the total emissivity at solar metallicity scales approximately as 
\begin{align*}
    \epsilon_{\text{ff}} \propto T_\text{e}^{\frac{1}{2}} n_\text{e},
\end{align*}
with \(n_\text{e}\) and \(T_\text{e}\) as the electron number density and temperature, respectively. At lower temperatures (\(k_B T \lesssim \SI{2}{\kilo\electronvolt}\)), line emission becomes significant, with the emissivity being roughly described by 
\begin{align*}
    \epsilon \propto T_\text{e}^{-0.6} n_\text{e}.
\end{align*}

\section{eROSITA}
The extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) is a highly sensitive, wide-field X-ray telescope designed to capture deep and precise images across large areas of the sky. Mounted on the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory in a halo orbit around the second Lagrange Point, eROSITA operates within the 0.2 to 10.0 keV energy range. It is the first instrument to perform an all-sky imaging survey in the hard X-ray band (2.0 to 10.0 keV). In the soft X-ray band (0.5 to 2.0 keV), eROSITA boasts a sensitivity that is approximately 20 times greater than that of its predecessor, the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. eROSITA features seven identical mirror modules, known as Telescope Modules (TMs), each with 54 mirror shells in Wolter-I geometry and a 1.6-meter focal length. Five TMs (TM1, TM2, TM3, TM4, TM6) have aluminum on-chip optical light filters and are collectively referred to as TM8. The remaining two TMs (TM5, TM7), designed for low-energy spectroscopy, lack these filters and are referred to as TM9. (\cite{Predehl2021})

\section{Skybackground and contamination sources}
For a thorough analysis of X-ray photons, it is essential to carefully consider both external contamination and internal instrumental distortion effects. The following section will provide a brief overview of the most important factors.
\paragraph*{X-ray Background (XRB):} The X-ray background consists of multiple sources, including diffuse emissions from the Local Hot Bubble and the Galactic halo \cite{galeazzi2006xmm}, as well as discrete extragalactic sources, predominantly AGNs \cite{brandt2005deep}.
\paragraph*{Particle Induced Background (PIB)}
